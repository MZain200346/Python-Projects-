# My Python Projects

A collection of small Python scripts I built for fun while learning to code.

## What's Here

Just some simple tools and experiments I made to test my skills and learn new things. Nothing fancy, but they work!

### Projects

- **Python Calculator** - A simple Python calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. Clean and easy to use.
- **Weather Checker** - Gets current weather for any city
- **Password Generator** - Creates strong random passwords
- **Web Scraper** - Pulls basic info from websites

## Why I Made These

Mostly to practice Python and see what I could build on my own. Each project helped me learn something new.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run any script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-projects.git
cd python-projects
python script_name.py
